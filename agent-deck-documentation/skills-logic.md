# Skills in Agent Deck

Agent Deck treats skills as an explicit assignment system.

Core rule:

> A skill being discovered by Agent Deck does not mean it is injected into Pi. Agent Deck launches app-owned Pi RPC sessions with `--no-skills` and passes only assigned skills with explicit `--skill <path>` arguments.

This makes Agent Deck the source of truth for which skills are available to each parent session and native subagent.

## Skill catalog

The skill catalog is the list of skills Agent Deck can see on the user's machine or in the app bundle.

Agent Deck can discover skills from global, bundled, package, and explicit import/catalog sources, including:

| Source | Examples |
|---|---|
| Bundled skills | Skills shipped with Agent Deck, such as `agent-authoring`, `prompt-authoring`, and `skill-authoring`. |
| User/global skills | `~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, `~/.pi/agent/skills/<name>.md`. |
| Legacy global skills | Recursive `~/.agents/skills/**/SKILL.md`; root `.md` files are ignored. |
| Globally resolved package skills | Package-declared `pi.skills` or conventional package `skills/` folders from global package locations. |
| Imported/catalog skills | Existing skill roots the user adds through Agent Deck’s `+` import flow, including installed Codex Plugin skills. |

A catalog skill keeps its original path. Agent Deck does not need to move, copy, or link a skill before using it; import is by reference, not copy. Runtime injection is controlled by assignment, not by the folder where the skill lives. Agent Deck does not discover project-local `.pi/skills` or legacy project `.agents/skills` folders as resource catalog sources.

## Importing external skills

The Skills view import sheet lets a user choose either a skill root or a broader source folder. Agent Deck searches the chosen folder recursively for directories containing `SKILL.md`, stopping recursion when it reaches a skill root. This lets a user point at a repository or collection folder, review the discovered skill roots, and select only the skills they want.

Importing selected skills normally stores the selected skill root paths in Agent Deck settings. It does not store the broad search folder, copy files, or automatically assign the skills. The selected roots become catalog entries and are injected only when assigned as Default, Project, or Agent skills.

The **Claude / Codex** source also lists skills declared by locally installed Codex plugins. Agent Deck considers a cache package installed only when Codex config lists its exact `plugin@marketplace` identity (whether enabled or disabled), or its plugin base has a valid Codex remote-install marker. It selects Codex's active cache version before validating its manifest; an invalid active package is unavailable rather than falling back to stale content. Agent Deck never changes Codex files. Importing one of these candidates stores its marketplace, plugin, and relative skill root rather than a versioned cache path. Each resource scan resolves that reference to Codex's current active package; launches use the refreshed skill catalog from that scan. An imported plugin skill therefore follows updates and remains unavailable (but retained as a reference) if the plugin is removed. Its stable relative skill folder and skill name must remain present; renamed or removed skills need re-import rather than being silently remapped.


The broker is an external prerequisite and is not bundled into Agent Deck. From an Agent Deck source checkout, install the reviewed upstream package and deterministic derived variant into the explicit Application Support paths with:

```bash
```


When a local-folder import or Git import contains selected skills and the user enables **Import as collection**, Agent Deck also records a first-class Skill Collection with the chosen name for that source. A collection is assignment metadata, not a runtime primitive: enabling a collection for All Projects or a project expands the collection to its member skill names, then launch resolution still emits one `--skill <path>` argument for each resolved skill. Removing a skill from the catalog removes it from collection membership. Git-backed collection details expose the same repository check/update workflow as their individual skills and continue to share the repository record and sparse-checkout metadata used for updates.

## Bundled authoring skills

Agent Deck ships focused authoring skills for common resource creation workflows:

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agent-authoring` | Create or review Agent Deck native agent markdown files. |
| `prompt-authoring` | Create or improve reusable prompt templates for parent sessions. |
| `skill-authoring` | Create or improve Agent Deck/Pi skills and explain assignment behavior. |

These bundled skills are catalog resources. They follow the same assignment rules as other skills: they are not injected into a parent session or native subagent unless assigned.

## Assignment types

A discovered skill can be assigned directly or through a collection.

| Assignment | Meaning | Runtime effect |
|---|---|---|
| Default | The skill, or every member of a Default collection, is available to every parent Pi Agent session. | Parent sessions receive one `--skill <path>` per resolved skill. |
| Project | The skill, or every member of a project collection, is available to parent Pi Agent sessions for one project. | Parent sessions for that project receive one `--skill <path>` per resolved skill. |
| Agent | The skill is available to one native subagent. | That child process receives `--skill <path>` when the agent runs. |

Unassigned skills are visible in the catalog but are not injected anywhere.

Default skills are not automatically assigned to agents. Native agents receive only skills explicitly assigned to that agent.

## Parent Pi Agent sessions

Parent sessions receive:

```text
Default skills
+ skills assigned to the current project
```

Agent Deck launches parent Pi RPC sessions with:

```text
--no-skills
--skill <default-skill-path>
--skill <project-assigned-skill-path>
```

Parent sessions do not receive:

- unassigned skills,
- skills assigned only to another project,
- skills assigned only to native agents,
- assigned skills that no longer exist in the Agent Deck skill catalog,
- package/user/imported skills merely because Pi could discover them on disk,
- project-local `.pi/skills` or legacy project `.agents/skills` resources.

Example:

```text
pi --mode rpc \
  --no-skills \
  --skill /Users/me/.pi/agent/skills/default-review/SKILL.md \
  --skill /Users/me/SkillRepositories/app-patterns/SKILL.md
```

## Native subagents

Native subagents receive only their own assigned skills.

Missing Default or Project skill assignments are skipped at parent-session launch time so a deleted external skill does not block the composer. The stale assignment remains visible in settings/warnings so the user can restore the skill or remove the obsolete assignment explicitly.

Agent skills are stored on the agent as `skills:` names:

```yaml
---
name: reviewer
description: Reviews diffs and implementation plans
tools: read, grep, find, ls, bash, contact_supervisor
skills: review-guidelines, app-patterns
systemPromptMode: replace
---
```

When that agent runs, Agent Deck resolves the skill names to catalog entries and launches the child with:

```text
--no-skills
--skill <review-guidelines-path>
--skill <app-patterns-path>
```

Native subagents do not inherit Default skills or Project skills automatically. If a subagent needs a skill, assign that skill to the agent.

The `inheritSkills` frontmatter field is preserved for compatibility, but current Agent Deck child launches always use `--no-skills` plus explicit agent-assigned `--skill` arguments. Ambient skill discovery is not used for native subagents.

## Native Pi skill behavior

Agent Deck uses Pi's native skill mechanism.

Explicit `--skill <path>` arguments are honored even when `--no-skills` is present:

```text
--no-skills
--skill /path/to/SKILL.md
```

Pi adds the skill to its native skill catalog in the system prompt, similar to:

```xml
<available_skills>
  <skill>
    <name>agent-authoring</name>
    <description>Use when creating or reviewing Agent Deck native agents.</description>
    <location>/path/to/agent-authoring/SKILL.md</location>
  </skill>
</available_skills>
```

Pi does not paste the full skill body into the initial system prompt. The model uses the `read` tool to load the full skill file when the skill is relevant.

This also applies to native subagents whose `systemPromptMode` is `replace`: `--system-prompt` replaces Pi's base prompt, and Pi still appends the explicit skill catalog after that prompt.

## Read tool requirement

Because Pi's native skill system points the model at a skill file, any runtime with assigned skills must be able to use the `read` tool.

Parent sessions normally have `read` available.

For native subagents:

- If tools are omitted, Pi's normal tool behavior applies and skills can be loaded.
- If tools are explicitly allowlisted, the list must include `read` when the agent has assigned skills.
- If `tools: []` or an allowlist without `read` is used with assigned skills, Agent Deck blocks the launch and shows an error.

Example error:

```text
Agent `reviewer` has assigned skills but cannot load them because its tool allowlist does not include `read`. Add `read` to the agent tools or remove the assigned skills.
```

Agent Deck does not silently add `read`, because that would change the agent's declared tool boundary.

## Duplicate skill names

Skill assignments are resolved by skill name.

If two catalog entries have the same name, Agent Deck treats that as ambiguous.

Behavior:

- The sidebar and Skills UI show a warning.
- Any launch that would need the ambiguous skill is blocked.
- Agent Deck does not pick a winner silently.

Example:

```text
Cannot launch Pi session because skill `agent-authoring` is ambiguous.

Matching skills:
- Bundled: /Applications/Agent Deck.app/.../bundled-skills/agent-authoring/SKILL.md
- User: /Users/me/.pi/agent/skills/agent-authoring/SKILL.md

Rename one skill or remove one assignment, then try again.
```

## Helpers

Session title generation and commit-message generation remain isolated helper sessions.

They launch with:

```text
--no-skills
--no-tools
--no-session
```

They never receive assigned skills.

## Runtime matrix

| Runtime | Skill behavior |
|---|---|
| Parent Pi Agent session | `--no-skills` + `--skill` for Default and current Project assignments. |
| Native subagent child | `--no-skills` + `--skill` for that agent's assigned skills only. |
| Session title helper | `--no-skills`, no `--skill`. |
| Commit-message helper | `--no-skills`, no `--skill`. |
